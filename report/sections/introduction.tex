\section*{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

The purpose of this assignment is to find the differences between the \verb|word2Vec| and the \verb|SVD| methods to generate dense word representations from a given corpus. Finally, from the obtained embeddings, I train a classifier on the Downstream task of sentence label prediction using a bidirectional LSTM, which helps in providing a clear analysis of the various methods and their corresponding pros and cons.
