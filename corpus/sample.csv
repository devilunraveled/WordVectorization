For example, a function which takes some time to complete and returns True when done. How can I display a progress bar during the time the function is being executed? Note that I need this to be in real time, so I can't figure out what to do about it. Do I need a thread for this? I have no idea. Right now I am not printing anything while the function is being executed, however a progress bar would be nice. Also I am more interested in how this can be done from a code point of view.
